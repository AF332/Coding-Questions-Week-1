# Question 6
# Create a variable to hold a 4 digit number
# Use indexing of the string to individually print each number in a different line

four_digit = input("Enter a four digit number: ")

print(four_digit[0])
print(four_digit[1])
print(four_digit[2])
print(four_digit[3])

# very scummy way of doing it 
# Also floats and integers can't use indexing but lists etc can cos they are subsricptable
